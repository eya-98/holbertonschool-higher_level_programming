## Higher level programming  
# Definition 
- It can be easily interpreted as well as compiled.
- It can be considered as a programmer-friendly language.
- It is easy to understand.
- It is easy to debug.
- It is simple in terms of maintenance.
- It requires a compiler/interpreter to be translated into machine code.
- It can be run on different platforms.
- It is less memory efficient, i.e it consumes more memory in comparison to low-level languages.
- Examples of high level languages include C++, Javascript, java, Python.
- It is used widely in today's times.
# difference between low level and higher level :
- Low-level languages require little interpretation by the computer. This makes machine code fast compared to other programming languages. Low-level languages gives programmers more control over data storage, memory, and computer hardware. It’s typically used to write kernel or driver software. It wouldn’t be used to write web applications or games.  
- In contrast, high-level languages are easier to grasp. It allows a programmer to write code more efficiently. High-level languages have more safeguards to keep coders from issues commands that could potentially damage a computer. These languages don’t give programmers as much control as low-level ones do.
